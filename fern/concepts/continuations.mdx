## What are Continuations?

Continuations refers to the ability to extend audio generation segments across multiple sequential inputs. This is also known as **conditioning on past generations**.

This document will cover concepts, for more on implementation see [here](/reference/web-socket/stream-speech/working-with-web-sockets#input-streaming-with-contexts). Note that **continuations are only available through the [websocket endpoint](/reference/web-socket/stream-speech/stream-speech)**.

## Why should I use Continuations?

Given a large transcript or multiple transcripts, technically you could generate all sections independently and stitch them together to get the resulting audio. However, this is both inefficient and also results in unstable audio quality. Let's consider the simple example of `Hello, my name is Sonic. It's very nice to meet you.`

### Prosody

</figure>

Let's split the example transcript into 3 parts. Transcript 1 will be `Hello, my name is Sonic.`, Transcript 2 will be `It's very nice`, and Transcript 3 will be `to meet you.`. We can generate each independently and combine them to get our final result:

Technically we've achieved TTS for the example transcript, but I think we can all agree this sounds incredibly weird. There are two main problems with this:
- The [prosody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosody_(linguistics)) is off between the clips, so it doesn't sound like a natural sentence. This is because `It's very nice` doesn't know that there's more to the sentence, and `to meet you.` doesn't know that something came before it.
- The breaks between audio 1, audio 2, and audio 3 are too short relative to a normal speaking cadence.

Let's try the same transcripts, but using continuations:

We can hear that the transcript flows much more naturally. 

### Multiple inputs

You'll notice in Figure 2 that there's an `Audio N...` section in the output audio as well. This is because continuations allows you to chain any N inputs together for a coherent audio output.

### What if I want to stream in word by word?

![](/assets/images/concepts_continuations_multiple_inputs.png)

Let's try the following transcripts with continuations: `['Hello, my name is Sonic.', 'It's', 'very', 'nice', 'to', 'meet', 'you.']`

<audio controls src="https://cartesia-docs-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/concepts/continuations/with_continuations_many_inputs.wav">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

One of the more common use-cases we've seen is using an LLM of your choice to stream text into our Text-To-Speech API. Our current API will optimally buffer on our server side, but since some of our users want to generate audio from short snippets, we only begin buffering after first submission. What this means is **you need to buffer the first chunk on your end**.

<Note>
We recommend having the first chunk be a sentence, and then you can stream in token by token.
</Note>

We'll be adding a flag shortly in the future to begin the buffering from the first chunk.

### Cancellations

Many of us know the feeling of kicking off a massive job and then realizing that we've made a grave mistake. Luckily we support cancellations. If you haven't signaled the transcript submissions (an empty transcript with `continue=False`), you can submit a cancellation request to prevent queued generations from occurring. This can be helpful for managing concurrency and character usage.
