title: Spelling Out Input Text

To spell out input text, you can wrap it in `<spell>` tags.

This is particularly useful for pronouncing long numbers or identifiers, such as credit card numbers, phone numbers, or unique IDs.

## Examples

```xml
My phone number is <spell>(123) 456-7890</spell> and my credit card is <spell>1234-5678-9012-3456</spell>.
```

If you want to spell out numbers or identifiers and have planned breaks between the generations (e.g. taking a break between the area code of a phone number and the rest of that number), you can combine `<break>` and `<spell tags>`. 

```xml
My phone number is <spell>(123)</spell> <break time="200ms"/> <spell>4712177</spell> and my credit card number is <spell>1234</spell> <break time="200ms"/> <spell>5678</spell> <break time="200ms"/> <spell>6347</spell> <break time="200ms"/> <spell>4537</spell>.
```
