### Continuous updates

`sonic` and `sonic-preview` are aliases for the latest stable and preview models. We recommend using these for prototyping and development, then switching to a dated model for production use cases to ensure stability.

## Sonic

_Sonic_ is our flagship text-to-speech model. It produces high-accuracy, expressive speech, and is optimized for efficiency to achieve low latency.

- **Model alias:** `sonic`
- **Release date:** Dec 2024
- **Latest version:** `sonic-2024-12-12`

To learn how to use Sonic, see [Make an API request](/get-started/make-an-api-request).


## Sonic Preview

Sonic Preview is our latest preview snapshot. It is updated regularly, and may not be as stable as `sonic`. Use `sonic-preview` to see the latest features and research direction from Cartesia.

The latest version of `sonic-preview` demonstrates superior transcript following, especially for dates, long numbers, and phone numbers.

- **Model alias:** `sonic-preview`
- **Supported languages:** en

* Audio generations may occasionally sound fast.
* Some long numbers and phone numbers may sound rushed as well.

### Sonic Multilingual (deprecated)

_Sonic Multilingual_ was the first multilingual Sonic variant, with improved transcript following and low latency.  While it is still supported in our API, we recommend using the `sonic` model instead.
