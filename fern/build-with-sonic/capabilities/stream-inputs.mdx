title: Stream Inputs using Continuations
subtitle: Learn how to stream input text to the Sonic API.

In many real-time use cases, you don't have input text available upfront—like when you're generating it on the fly using a language model. For these cases, Sonic supports input streaming through a feature we call _continuations_.

<Info>
This guide will cover how input streaming works from the perspective of the Sonic model. If you just want to implement input streaming, see [the WebSocket API reference](/api-reference/tts/tts), which implements continuations using _contexts_.

## Continuations

Continuations are generations that extend already generated speech. They're called continuations because you're continuing the generation from where the last one left off, maintaining the _prosody_ of the previous generation.

If you don't use continuations, you get sudden changes in prosody that create seams in the audio.

<Note>
Prosody refers to the rhythm, intonation, and stress in speech. It's what makes speech flow naturally and sound human-like.
</Note>

Let's say we're using an LLM and it generates a transcript in three parts, with a one second delay between each part:

1. `Hello, my name is Sonic.`
2. ` It's very nice`
3. ` to meet you.`

To generate speech for the whole transcript, we might think to generate speech for each part independently and stitch the audios together:

Unfortunately, we end up with speech that has sudden changes in prosody and strange pacing:

Now, let's try the same transcripts, but using continuations. The setup looks like this:

<Frame caption="Figure 2: Generate transcripts using continuations." background="subtle">

</Frame>

Here's what we get:

As you can hear, this output sounds seamless and natural.

You can scale up continuations to any number of inputs. There is no limit.

## Caveat: Streamed inputs should form a valid transcript when joined

This means that `Hello, world!` can be followed by ` How are you?` (note the leading space) but not `How are you?`, since when joined they form the invalid transcript `Hello, world!How are you?`.

In practice, this means you should maintain spacing and punctuation in your streamed inputs.

## Caveat: Word-by-word or token-by-token inputs

> **TL;DR:** If you want to stream the input in word-by-word, your code should buffer the first sentence of the input upfront. Then you can stream the remaining input text word-by-word.

Let's try the following transcripts with continuations: `['Hello, my name is Sonic.', "It's ", 'very ', 'nice ', 'to ', 'meet ', 'you.']`
