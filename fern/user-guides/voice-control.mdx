## Controlling Voices through Speed & Emotion

The `__experimental_controls` parameter allows you to fine-tune the voice output by adjusting speed and emotion. This feature is currently experimental and may be subject to changes in future API versions.

### Usage

Add the `__experimental_controls` dictionary to the `voice` object in your API request:

```json
"voice": {
  "mode": "id",
  "id": "VOICE_ID",
  "__experimental_controls": {
    "speed": "normal",
    "emotion": [
      "positivity:high",
      "curiosity"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Speed Control

The `speed` parameter adjusts the pace of speech. Available options are:

- `"slowest"`: Very slow speech
- `"slow"`: Slower than normal speech
- `"normal"`: Default speech rate
- `"fast"`: Faster than normal speech
- `"fastest"`: Very fast speech

For more granular control, you can define speed as a float within the range [-1.0, 1.0]. A value of 0.0 represents the default speed, while negative values slow down the speech and positive values speed it up.

Example:
```json
"__experimental_controls": {
  "speed": "fast"
}
```

Example with float value:
```json
"__experimental_controls": {
  "speed": -0.1
}
```

### Emotion Control

The `emotion` parameter is an array of emotion tags that modify the voice's tone by adding emotion. Each tag follows the format `"emotion_name:level"`.

#### Emotion Names:
- `anger`
- `positivity`
- `surprise`
- `sadness`
- `curiosity`

#### Emotion Levels:
- `lowest`: Slight addition of the emotion
- `low`: Mild addition of the emotion
- (omit level for moderate addition of the emotion)
- `high`: Strong addition of the emotion
- `highest`: Maximum addition of the emotion

Example:
```json
"__experimental_controls": {
  "emotion": [
    "curiosity",
    "positivity:high"
  ]
}
```

In this example, the voice will express:
- High positivity
- Medium curiosity (level omitted)
- Low surprise

### Combining Speed and Emotion

You can combine both speed and emotion controls:

```json
"__experimental_controls": {
  "speed": "fast",
  "emotion": [
    "positivity:high",
    "curiosity"
  ]
}
```

This configuration will result in fast speech with high positivity and medium curiosity.

### Notes

- All emotion tag levels add the specified emotion to the voice. They don't reduce or remove emotions, but rather add them in varying intensities.
- The effects of these controls may vary depending on the chosen voice and the content being spoken.
- Experiment with different combinations to achieve the desired output for your use case.
- If the voice is unstable, reducing the magnitude of the added modifications and reducing the number of different modifications added should help.
- As this is an experimental feature, be prepared for potential changes or updates in future API versions.
